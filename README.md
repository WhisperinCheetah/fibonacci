# Fibonacci
This is a personal project around the fibonacci sequence. I wanted to see how far I could optimize the calculation of this sequence and what is needed to represent absurdly large values in c. For this I created a datatype called uintx_t. It contains an array of uint8's which represent the value in Base 10.
